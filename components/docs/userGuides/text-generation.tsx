    question: "AI response delay",
    answer:
      "If you're experiencing delays in AI responses, check your internet connection for stability. Slow or interrupted networks can affect response times. Try refreshing the page or switching to a more stable connection. If delays persist, server load may be high—please wait a few moments and try again.",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    question: "File upload failure",
    answer:
      "Ensure the file you're uploading is in a supported format (e.g., PDF, PNG, JPG, DOCX) and within the size limit. Try renaming the file if you continue to experience issues. Also, check your internet connection or try using a different browser.",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    question: "Voice input not working",
    answer:
      "Voice input requires microphone access. Go to your browser settings and make sure microphone permissions are enabled for this site. Also confirm that your device’s microphone is connected and functioning correctly. Reload the page after granting access.",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: "Error message while processing",
    answer:
      "An error during processing may occur due to a system timeout, invalid input, or a temporary glitch. Try clearing your browser’s cache, rephrasing your prompt, or refreshing the page. If the issue continues, contact support with a screenshot of the error.",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    question: "Slow application performance",
    answer:
      "App performance may lag due to high memory usage on your device or heavy background processes. Try closing other applications and browser tabs, and consider restarting your device or browser to free up resources.",
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    question: "Generated response seems inaccurate or off-topic",
    answer:
      "This could be due to an unclear or overly broad prompt. Try rephrasing your request with more specific details or context. Avoid using vague terms and break complex instructions into smaller parts.",
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "The AI stopped mid-response",
    answer:
      "Sometimes long responses can get cut off due to system limits or a timeout. Try shortening your prompt or breaking it into smaller chunks. You can also type 'continue' to let the AI pick up from where it left off.",
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    question: "AI keeps repeating the same phrase",
    answer:
      "This can happen if the AI misinterprets the prompt or gets stuck in a loop. Rephrase your prompt to include variation or a different structure. If the repetition continues, refresh the chat or start a new session.",
  },
  {
    id: "9",
    question: "Can’t copy or select the AI response text",
    answer:
      "If you're unable to copy text, it may be due to a browser setting or disabled selection style. Try switching browsers or right-clicking to use the ‘Inspect’ option and manually select text from the HTML structure as a temporary workaround.",
  },
  {
    id: "10",
    question: "Chat history not loading or disappearing",
    answer:
      "Chat history may fail to load due to browser cache issues or temporary server sync delays. Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache. If you're logged in, ensure your session hasn’t expired. For persistent issues, log out and back in.",
  },
  {
    id: "11",
    question: "Prompt not submitting after pressing Enter",
    answer:
      "If the prompt doesn't submit, make sure you're not in multiline mode (Shift + Enter). Also, check your keyboard input settings or try submitting using the on-screen button. Reload the app if the issue persists.",

              <p className="mt-2 text-muted-foreground text-sm sm:text-base">
                Sometimes, the generated text might require some refinement to
                perfectly match your requirements. Here are some tips:

                    If the generated text isn't quite what you were looking for,
                    try refining your original prompt. Be more specific or try a
                    different phrasing. You can also experiment with different
                    AI models.
