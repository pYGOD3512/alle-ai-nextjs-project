    question: "How do I ensure the best results from audio generation?",
    answer:
      "To get the best results, provide detailed and specific prompts. Include elements like tone, duration, style, and mood. Experiment with different combinations and refine your prompts based on the results.",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    question: "Can I download the generated audio files?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can download the generated audio files in various formats such as MP3 and WAV. Simply click the download icon on the audio player.",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: "Is there a limit to the number of audio files I can generate?",
    answer:
      "The number of audio files you can generate may depend on your subscription plan. Free users may have certain limitations, while premium users enjoy higher limits and additional features.",

  {
    id: "5",
    question: "Why is my generated audio distorted or unclear?",
    answer:
      "Distorted or unclear audio may result from an overly complex or vague prompt. Try simplifying the prompt or adjusting parameters like tone or style. Also, check your model settings for higher quality output.",
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    question: "Why are the audio files taking longer to generate?",
    answer:
      "Longer generation times may occur during high demand or when using more complex models. You can try again later, or consider upgrading your subscription plan for faster processing.",
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "Can I modify the generated audio after it's been created?",
    answer:
      "Currently, editing the generated audio directly on the platform is not supported. However, you can download the file and use third-party software for further editing if needed.",
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    question: "Why can't I hear the audio after generating it?",

  },
  {
    id: "11",
    question: "Why do some generated audio files sound robotic?",
    answer:
      "Robotic-sounding audio may happen with speech synthesis models that aren't trained for a natural-sounding voice. Try adjusting the tone or selecting a different voice model to improve the quality of speech generation.",
  },
  {
    id: "12",
    question: "Can I use generated audio for commercial purposes?",
    answer:
      "Yes, generated audio can be used for commercial purposes depending on your subscription plan. Make sure to review the licensing terms for each AI model you use.",
