        This guide will help you understand how to craft effective prompts to
        get the best results from [Your Website Name]. Whether you're new to
        using AI models or looking to refine your skills, this guide will
        provide tips, examples, and best practices for structuring prompts
        effectively.

      <h2 className="text-3xl mb-4">Why Are Prompts Important?</h2>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-8">
        Prompts are the instructions or questions you provide to an AI model to
        generate a response. The quality of your prompt directly impacts the
        quality of the output. A well-structured prompt can lead to accurate,
        relevant, and detailed responses, while a poorly structured one may
        result in vague or irrelevant answers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl mb-4">Tips for Crafting Effective Prompts</h2>
      <ul className="text-muted-foreground mb-8 space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Be Clear and Specific:</strong> Avoid vague language. Clearly
          state what you want the model to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide Context:</strong> Give the model enough background
          information to understand your request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Examples:</strong> If possible, include examples of the
          type of response you're looking for.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Break Down Complex Tasks:</strong> For multi-part questions,
          break them into smaller, manageable steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterate and Refine:</strong> If the response isn't what you
          expected, tweak your prompt and try again.
        </li>
      </ul>

          <strong>Being Too Vague:</strong> Example: "Tell me about history."

        <li>
          <strong>Overloading the Prompt:</strong> Example: "Write a story about
          a hero, include dragons, magic, a love story, and a twist ending, and
          make it funny but also serious." Fix: "Write a short fantasy story

          the hero's journey and include a twist ending."

          <strong>Ignoring Context:</strong> Example: "Explain this concept."
