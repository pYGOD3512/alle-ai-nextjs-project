        In the world of AI, no single model has all the answers. Each has unique strengths, weaknesses, and biases. 
        By comparing responses from multiple models, you get more reliable information, diverse perspectives, and 
        protection against AI hallucinationsâ€”those convincing but incorrect answers that can lead you astray.

            Studies show that AI models can hallucinate facts up to 27% of the time when answering complex questions. 
            Using multiple models can reduce this error rate by identifying inconsistencies between responses.
